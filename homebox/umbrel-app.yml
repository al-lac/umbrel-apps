releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ This update contains some changes to config values. If you customized the `HBOX_STORAGE_SQLITE_URL` please make sure to read the upgrade guide. Additionally, please note that for those wanting to switch to Postgres we currently do not have a migration tool to move from SQLite to Postgres.

  ⚠️ Due to the transition to ShadCN this release has a few known bugs we are still working out. This includes on mobile the sidebar being closed when a pup up is open, odd flickering on major browser window resizing, and the new label maker does not support some languages (Chinese, Korean, Japanese known), due to a Go font limitation.

  Key improvements and fixes:
    - Fixed broken navigation text in Chinese and set the correct value of html lang
    - Added keyboard accessible shortcut menu for create modals
    - Fixed lazy loading of item images not working
    - Fixed flash of wrong theme on initial UI load
    - Creation modal quality of life changes
    - Added search filter for items with no photo
    - Began switching from daisyui to shadcnui
    - Fixed the problem of the fixed height in the background of the location badge in the item cards
    - Fixed file upload size env in installation.md
    - Added label generation api
    - Fixed labelmaker font size mixed up and wrong defaults in docs
    - Added additional information on label, dynamic label layouting
    - Fixed screen large items
    - Fixed an issue with Notifiers
    - Changed the width of the items quantity badge to not be fixed
    - PostgreSQL Support!
