  Key improvements in this release:
    - Remember the previous location on the map when using the location edit feature
    - Face tagging enhancement – You can now search for a person’s name; the form color is adapted to follow the theme brightness.
    - Fixed an issue where the tagged face is reset when running the “Refresh faces” job.
    - Fixed an issue where faces could not be tagged in videos. Note that the face tag on video is for facial information only, as it is taken from the thumbnail as the source, not the video’s frame.
    - Fixed an issue where modified assets in an external library would be reimported every subsequent scan.
    - Fixed an issue with a long delay when running multiple ML endpoints.
    - Fixed an issue where the update notifier would show up too often
    - Fixed an issue where the deduplication has an erroneous behavior with stacked assets
    - Fixed an issue where duplicate memories are generated
    - Fixed an issue where the memory “years ago” text is off by one
    - Fixed an issue where the background backup kept crashing on Android
