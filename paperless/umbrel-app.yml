description: >-
  Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.

  - Organize and index your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more.

  - Your data is stored locally on your server and is never transmitted or shared in any way.

  - Performs OCR on your documents, adding searchable and selectable text, even to documents scanned with only images.

  - Utilizes the open-source Tesseract engine to recognize more than 100 languages.

  - Documents are saved as PDF/A format which is designed for long term storage, alongside the unaltered originals.

  - Uses machine-learning to automatically add tags, correspondents and document types to your documents.

  - Supports PDF documents, images, plain text files, Office documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and LibreOffice equivalents)1 and more.

  - Paperless stores your documents plain on disk. Filenames and folders are managed by paperless and their format can be configured freely with different configurations assigned to different documents.
